= Lab 5 - Leveraging Spring Cloud Data Flow

This lab is based off the article link:https://content.pivotal.io/blog/building-flexible-data-pipelines-with-spring-cloud-data-flow-for-pcf[Building Flexible Data Pipelines with Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF] written by Chris Sterling. Please see this article for details and lab.

== FIRST, install the Cloudr Foundry CLI Plugin
The Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF Cloud Foundry CLI plugin is available through the Cloud Foundry Community Plugins repository.

To install the plugin, run the following command:

----
$ cf install-plugin -r CF-Community "spring-cloud-dataflow-for-pcf"
----

Next, for the lab, the link:http://docs.pivotal.io/scdf/index.html[Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF] documentation includes a link:http://docs.pivotal.io/scdf/getting-started.html[Getting Started with Spring CloudÂ® Data Flow for PCF] lab similar to that in the article above, but with more lab details and images. Please continue there for the lab work, after installing the CF CLI plugin.
