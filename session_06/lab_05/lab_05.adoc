= Lab 5 - Leveraging Spring Cloud Data Flow

This lab is based off the blog link:https://content.pivotal.io/blog/building-flexible-data-pipelines-with-spring-cloud-data-flow-for-pcf[Building Flexible Data Pipelines with Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF] written by Chris Sterling. This blog will be the basis for the lab, but first install the Cloud Foundry CF CLI plugin below.

== FIRST, install the Cloud Foundry CLI Plugin
The Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF Cloud Foundry CLI plugin is available through the Cloud Foundry Community Plugins repository.

To install the plugin, run the following command:

----
$ cf install-plugin -r CF-Community "spring-cloud-dataflow-for-pcf"
----

Next, for the lab, visit the blog link:https://content.pivotal.io/blog/building-flexible-data-pipelines-with-spring-cloud-data-flow-for-pcf[Building Flexible Data Pipelines with Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF]. You may read the top section of the blog or proceed directly to the section *"Getting Started: Creating Your First Data Pipeline"*.

After the lab, visit the link:http://docs.pivotal.io/scdf/index.html[Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF] documentation. It does includes a link:http://docs.pivotal.io/scdf/getting-started.html[Getting Started with Spring CloudÂ® Data Flow for PCF] lab similar to that in the article above, but with more lab details and images. Please look there for more details about _Spring Cloud Data Flow_.
